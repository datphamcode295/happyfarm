# happyfarm: IoT React Native application
In industrial agriculture, we cannot control all natural elements in such a enormous area. Due to the development of technology, devices are able to connect each others through Inter-
net(always called IoT technology). The increment of crop yield would be affected if undesirable factors could not be controlled. With IoT, this system can help us check the temperature, hu-
midity, and air concentration of the environment as soon as possible so that we can adjust the
amount of water saving appropriately through a mobile device. Besides, light intensity is also a
important factor affecting plant growth, which can be checked through light sensors.
